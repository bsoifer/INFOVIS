The goal of visualization is to aid our understanding of data by leveraging the human visual system's highly tuned ability to see patterns, spot trends, and identify outliers
graphical perception
In many situations, simple data graphics will not only suffice, they may also be preferible
you don't go to the zoo to see Chihuahuas and raccoons; you go to admire the majestic polar bear, the graceful zebra, and the terrifying Sumatran tiger
all visualizations share a common "DNA"
With some forms of time-series data, raw values are less important than relative changes
stacking may make it difficult to accurately interpret trends that lie atop other curves
data density
data resolution
properties of the data
exploratory data analisis
Clusters
Multivariate data 
picturing data in more than three dimensions
Reordering dimensions can aid pattern finding
cartographic projection
a flow map can depict the movement of a quantity in space and (implicitly) in time
One common error is to encode raw data values (such as population) rather than using normalized values to produce a density map
the area directly encodes a data variable
node-link diagram
treemap recursively subdivides area into rectangles
circle-packing layout
a bridge between disparate groups
effective layout
Layout techniques
graph distance
edge crossings
one-dimensional layout of nodes
seriation
adjacency matrix
Using color or saturation instead of text allows values associated with the links to be perceived more rapidly
the order of rows and columns is important
clusters and bridges
the DNA underlying all visualizations remains the same: the principled mapping of data variables to visual features such as position, size, shape, and color.
